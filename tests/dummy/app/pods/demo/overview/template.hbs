  <h1>TLDR</h1>
  <p>
    <b>ember-frost-modal</b> is a modal platform and component library built
    using <a href='https://github.com/ef4/ember-elsewhere' target=_blank>ember-elsewhere</a>
    and <a href='https://github.com/ember-animation/liquid-fire' target=_blank>liquid-fire</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The modal platform consists of:
    <ul>
      <li>a binding to {{#link-to 'demo.blur'}}blur{{/link-to}} the background when a modal is active</li>
      <li>a {{#link-to 'demo.remote-outlet'}}remote outlet{{/link-to}} that controls:
        <ul>
          <li>background opacity</li>
          <li>capturing clicks outside of the modal</li>
          <li>positioning the modal on the page</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>a {{#link-to 'demo.local-binding-basic'}}local binding{{/link-to}} that controls:
        <ul>
          <li>visiblity of a given modal component with custom parameters</li>
          <li>close, cancel and confirm actions</li>
          <li>animation transitions</li>
          <li>outlet customization</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike some other modal platforms, modals are components that remain completely within the Ember
    rendered DOM and lifecycle, so complex content can be included in modals with assurance that bindings
    and DOM management are handled as expected for an Ember component.
  </p>
  <p>
    The component library currently ships with <b>6</b> unique components and <b>1</b> animation.  At least
    1 more component and 2 more animations are in development and we would be happy to add more.
